<h2>My Classes</h2>

	<p>These are the classes I took this past spring. </p>

<h3>Writing Center Theory and Practice </h3>
		<p>This class prepared me to work at the Writing Center at Virginia Tech, located in Newman Library.  The course consisted of lectures and discussions conducted in a classroom setting, as well as practice time spent in the actual Writing Center.  There, I met with my writing partner, Lujing, once a week every week to help her study for the TOEFL.  Towards the end of the year, I also met with regular clients who arranged meetings by appointment. </p>

<h3>Topics in Literature by Women: Women and Madness</h3>
    <p>This class focued on literature written throughout the years, by women, particularly pertaining to the topics of women, madness, and how they relate to one another. Every week select students in the class would present their findings from the book <i>Women and Madness</i> by Phyllis Chesler.  We also had other readings, including <i>A Room of One's Own</i> by Virginia Woolf and <i>Persepolis</i> by Marjane Satrapi. Films were a part of our curriculum as well, and served to complement our literary selections.  </p>
    
<h3>Intro to Women's and Gender Studies</h3>
    <p>This class served as an introduction to the discipline of Women's and Gender Studies.  Several questions and topics were covered, including the stereotypical roles of men and women and how they can be defied, how those roles came into being and how they are harmful, to name a few.  Weekly assignments consisted of journal entries recording our responses to the readings.  Part of our participation for the class consisted of attending activist movements and seminars outside of class, including Take Back the Night and a talk given by Opal Tometi, co-founder of Black Lives Matter.</p>
    
<h3>Literature and Cinema</h3>
    <p>This class was based on the critical reading and analysis of various works of literature and their filmic translations.  The main focus of this class was to determine just what made a good film translation, whether a movie should stay true to the book or deviate, as well as how films and literature should be understood as two completely different artistic mediums.  Written works included <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> by Ken Kesey, "It Had to Be Murder" by Cornell Woolrich, <i>Xala</i> by Sembene Ousmane, "The Dead" by James Joyce, and <i>The Player</i> by Michael Tolkin. </p>
   
<h3>Intro to Cinema</h3>
   <p>This class served as an introduction to the discipline of Cinema.  Various topics served as the focus of each week, including cinematography, editing, sound, character, and the like.  Each week there was one film showing held on Monday nights in Hancock Hall.  Some films included Blade Runner, Atonement, Singin' in the Rain, etc.  There were three exams held throughout the course, which served as the only grades.  The final exam was not cumulative, which was nice.  </p>
